### Whats on my mind
- "Don't be a baby about it, be about it baby!"
- Calculus 2 is challenging.
- Although it is tough, I like the feeling of being in the mathlab with my peers. Being around individuals who are willing to put themselves through a series difficult obstacles in order to better themselves and their lives.
- Sometimes my mind goes into negative states of mind and luckily I am able to notice this feelings.
- I've been reading and asking advice from people who graduated from college with a STEM degree and they can all relate.
- I am aware that I am not the only one in this situation and that this is all very necessary.
- I am building toward my future and I am willing to do what is necessary to be successful.
